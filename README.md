Made this while following an online course on React & Redux.

The app uses the Youtube API to search and display youtube videos.
The search feature doesn't need to press enter or click a button. It searches as you type. 

To install the app: clone/download the folder. In terminal, go to that folder and yarn install (the dependencies). Then yarn start to start the application. After that, open your browser and go to localhost:8080.
